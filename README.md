Voltage Reference Board
=========================

Vehicle battery voltage monitor IoT. Measures the voltage of a 12V car battery. Sends this to a receiver device which pushes the data to the cloud.

This PCB is designed to fit in the car strapped between the battery terminals. It uses either a LoRA RFM95 module, or a sub Ghz modules RFM69HCW module. Other parts of the design mostly use low cost modules to reduce the hand assembly time. Some through hole components, SMD 0805 and SMD diodes require hand assembly.

Incorporates support for:- 
* Arduino Pro Mini
* RFM95/RFM69HCW module
* SMA 50 ohm antenna connector
* 16 bit ADC module TI 1115
* SHT31 temperature/humidity sensor module
* RGB LED to visually indicate voltage levels
* DC-DC converter
* Fuse and reverse voltage protection
* [Optional] Winbond flash storage
* [Optional] OLED display interface for debug purposes
* [Optional] HM-10 Bluetooth LE module carrier footprint
